# (N+1)-Gram Probabilities in English and Russian languages

### What are N-gram probabilities?

Ever wondered what is the probability of character X to be placed after character Y in English or Russian (or bring your own) languages? No? Well I did, and built this simple script to calculate it.

Why do you need it? Perhaps you want to violate Apple's patents or just doing some linguistic exploration. Up to you.

### How to run

It is extremely complicated, requires specialized knowledge, and I would not recommend anyone attempt it, unless you know what you are doing. Read the steps below with caution.

```javascript
npm i
npm start
```

Place your `.txt` files with a single word on each line inside the `input` folder, and change the `inputFileName` to your file's name. Or touch nothing and enjoy the work I did for you.

Feel free to change `upToNGram` (starts from 1) to what ever depth you need (single, bigrams, trigrams, infinity-grams-and-beyond).

### Results 

The script will do its magic and save the output in the `output` folder. Duh.

Why would you?
